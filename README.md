# CO2-gas-detector
The "CO2 Gas Detector using MQ135 Sensor and Arduino" is an innovative project designed to monitor and detect carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the surrounding environment. This project utilizes an MQ135 gas sensor, Arduino microcontroller, and related components to create a functional CO2 monitoring system.
Components:
1. MQ135 Gas Sensor: This sensor is the heart of the system and is responsible for detecting CO2 concentrations in the air.

2. Arduino Microcontroller: The Arduino acts as the control unit, processing data from the MQ135 sensor and displaying it on an output device.

3. Display Unit: An optional LCD or LED display can be used to show real-time CO2 levels for easy user interaction.

4. Power Supply: The project typically runs on a 5V power supply, which can be provided through USB or an external power source.

Working Principle:
1. The MQ135 sensor detects CO2 levels by measuring the resistance changes in its sensitive element when exposed to different gas concentrations.

2. The Arduino reads the analog output from the MQ135 sensor and converts it into a digital value.

3. The digital value is then processed and compared to predefined CO2 concentration thresholds.

4. If the CO2 concentration exceeds a set threshold, the system displays the reading on the chosen oled device.

Features:
- Real-time monitoring of CO2 levels.
- Adjustable CO2 concentration thresholds.
- Visual alerts when CO2 levels exceed the set limit.
- Data logging capabilities for long-term analysis.
- Low-cost and easy-to-build design.

Applications:
- Indoor air quality monitoring in homes, offices, and schools.
- Greenhouse environmental control.
- Industrial safety in areas with potential CO2 leaks.
- Research and experimentation in the field of environmental science.

This project not only provides valuable insights into CO2 levels but also promotes awareness about indoor air quality and its impact on health and the environment. It can be expanded upon by adding features like data logging, remote monitoring, or integration with IoT platforms to enhance its capabilities.
